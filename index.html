			<div class="period-text">
				The Medieval era was the beginning of written music. Pope Gregory, after whom the Gregorian chant is named, and the Catholic Church created music notation in order to record worship hymns. Medieval music is very basic, usually consisting of just a monophonic voice.

					Hildegard von Bingen
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/hildegard.jpg">
					<p><strong>St. Hildegard of Bingen</strong> (1098-1179) was not only a composer, but an abbess, author, doctor, and many other things. She was accomplished and respected, especially for a woman in an era when they had very little social status. Throughout her life, she experienced bright, noisy visions from God, starting from an early age. She recorded many of these visions as theological works.</p>

					<p>Hildegard was born in Bockelheim, Germany. Her parents did not know how to handle her visions, and entered her into a convent when she was seven. She was taught by the abbess, Jutta von Sponheim, and learned music from her. She became a nun there when she was around fifteen, and devoted her life to various forms of learning.</p>

					<p>Hildegard's music reflects her belief that the singing of angels is the highest, purest form of worship to God, and that instruments and human voices should try to imitate it. She received this from her visions. As such, our modern conception of what angels' choruses sound like is similar to her hymns. In Hildegard's time, polyphony had not been explored yet. Her music is largely monophonic representations, or "paintings", of her poetry.</p>

			<div class="period-text">
				The Renaissance period was a time of expanding knowledge and learning. Along with science, art and music were popularly developed. This period saw the beginning of polyphony: the use of multiple overlapping voices complementing each other in a single piece.

					<p><strong>Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz</strong> (1585-1672) straddles the line between the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Although his name is not as famous as Bach or Beethoven, without him it is likely that Bach's music would not have been what it is today.</p>

			<div class="period-title">Baroque</div>
			<div class="period-text">
				The Baroque period of music is characterised by significant use of ornaments and flowing ascending and descending passages of scales. Although it may not seem as such to a modern person, it was considered highly expressive and emotional at the time. The era valued flowerly and extravagant displays, not just in music but in architecture and fashion.

					Vivaldi
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/vivaldi.jpg">
					<p><strong>Antonio Vivaldi</strong> (1678-1741) is one of the famous names of the Baroque era. He wrote an incredible amount of music, each for a specific occasion. His music is bright, innovative and full of life. It never sounds boring.</p>

					<p>Vivaldi was born in 1678, in Venice, Italy. He was educated to be a priest as well as in music. However, his ill health allowed him to focus on music for his whole life. He was the head of the Conservatory of the Ospedale della Piet&agrave;, where he taught orphan girls music.</p>

					<p>Vivaldi, like other great composers, was a devout Christian. He wrote music as praise to God and often prayed and recited psalms, helped by his training as a priest. His preferred instrument was the violin. In fact, he did not write any music for vocals at all. However, his music was imaginative and descriptive, for example his famous piece <em>The Four Seasons</em>, which paints a brilliant picture of the atmosphere at different times of year.</p>

					Handel
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/handel.jpg">
					<p><strong>George Frideric Handel</strong> (1685-1759) was a Baroque composer from Halle, Germany. He wrote music with beautiful melody, and was known for his conveyance of emotion and mood. Like many Baroque composers and other great composers, he was a skilled organist and devout Christian.</p>

					<p>Handel was born in the same year as Bach, 1685. His father had wanted him to become a lawyer, but when his musical talents were noticed and encouraged by a duke, he gave in. He took a wide variety of music lessons under Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow from the ages of eight to seventeen. At this point in his life, he left his hometown, traveling around Europe to find inspiration for composing. He went first to Hamburg, Germany; then to Venice, Italy; and finally to England.</p>

					<p>Handel's music is bright and cheerful, beautiful in many ways.</p>

					Bach

				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/bach.jpg">
					<p><strong>Johann Sebastian Bach</strong> (1685-1750) is one of the greatest composers of all time. His musical influence is virtually unparalleled. Above all, he was a Christian. He included the abbreviations JJ and SDG in all his works, meaning <em>Jesus, help me</em> and <em>Glory to God Alone</em> in Latin. Bach respected Handel, who was born in the same year as him, but they never got to meet.</p>

					<p>Bach was born in Eisenach, Germany. He was orphaned at an early age, and went to study under his brother when he was ten. Throughout his life, he held various esteemed music positions, including court conductor and organist. Known as the master of counterpoint, his fugues and other compositions show a genius level of harmony and unity with several different voices. Additionally, he was a passionate organist.</p>

			<div class="period-title">Classical</div>
			<div class="period-text">
				After the Baroque period emerged the Classical period. It contrasted with the Baroque period as it held back on extravagant emotion, developing and strictly following forms and rules of music. Classical music often has relatively simple and straightforward melodies and chords.

				<div class="composer-title">
					Haydn
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/haydn.jpg">
					<p><strong>Franz Joseph Haydn</strong> (1732-1809) was a Classical composer from Austria. His compositions are simple and pure, reflecting his personality just like countless others. He relied on God throughout his life, and was cheerful and optimistic in everything. His music is clear, lighthearted and lovely.</p>

					<p>Haydn was born into a poor family in Rohrau, Austria. He was a choir singer from the ages of six to fifteen, and when he was seventeen he gave lessons and played the piano for a living. After moderate success composing, he travelled to England in 1791, where he gained great fame. Haydn also had a close relationship with Mozart. They were good friends and both learnt and improved their composing from each other.</p>

					<p>While Haydn was a master at composing, he did not write grand music to cater to critics. Instead, he wrote music to make people happy. He respected God greatly, and working hard was just one of his values. He would often pray for inspiration on days when he was not productive.</p>

					Mozart
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/mozart.jpg">
					<p><strong>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</strong> (1756-1791) is probably one of the most famous classical composers in the world. He was a musical genius, who thought about music with nearly every waking moment. Composing came with great ease to him, and he could write down his ideas with great speed. His music is light and carefree, contrary to his difficult life. His composing style clearly reflects his personality: hyperactive, excited and boyish.</p>

					<p>Mozart's talent manifested at a young age. His father noticed this, and brought him and his older sister to perform across Europe. However, after he moved to Vienna, he could not find a steady job to sustain him. In Vienna he also met Joseph Haydn, with whom he had a close friendship. During his lifetime, Mozart made hardly any money from his music, and he died in an unmarked paupers' grave. He died at a very early age, thirty-five, possibly from the sheer exhaustion of his lively lifestyle.</p>

					Beethoven
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/beethoven.jpg">

					<p><strong>Ludwig van Beethoven</strong> (1770-1827) was vital in the transition from the Classical to the Romantic period. He had a very unfriendly and complex personality, with a bad temper and contempt for all people. He also went through much suffering. Just to name a few: from an early age his father abused him when he didn't have good results in music; he was plagued by bad health and possibly mental illness throughout his life; and he went deaf towards the end of his life, which was devastating for a composer and pianist. </p>

					<p>It is because of the pain he experienced that he moved away from the restraint of the Classical era and poured out his emotions into his music. His music is full of sudden sharp contrasts, from sweet, <em>dolce</em> passages to furious, violent dynamic peaks: one of the first to deviate from the Classical style of Mozart and Haydn to write in this way.</p>

			<div class="period-text">
				Music in the Romantic era is highly emotional, with singing melodies and rich harmonies. Tempos and chords are less rigidly bound to rules, allowing for more freedom of expression.

					Schubert
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/schubert.jpg">
					<p><strong>Franz Schubert</strong> (1797-1828) is one of the foremost pioneers of the Romantic period. His is most famous for his songs, or <em>lieder</em>. These are written for a voice and accompaniment, with lyrics derived from poems. Schubert's <em>lieder</em> are beautifully harmonious and melodic. They bring about the mood of the poems flawlessly. His music expresses simply the contrasts between joy and sadness.</p>

					<p>Schubert was born in Vienna. He had a relatively difficult childhood, often without much to eat. He was taught in music from young at home, and entered a choir school. However, he became a schoolteacher according to his father's wishes, although he was not dedicated to the job and continued to write music. In 1816, he quit teaching to write music.He was dependent on his group of friends to survive, as he had no income.</p>

					<p>Schubert's friends all shared artistic ideas with each other. His music was not recognised in his lifetime, but he held to his faith in God and poured out emotion into his songs. When composing his songs, he felt humbled and inadequate compared to Beethoven, whom he admired greatly. Yet today we consider his music similarly great.</p>

					Chopin
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/chopin.jpg">
					<p><strong>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin</strong> (1810-1849) was a Romantic composer who loved his home country, Poland, as well as the piano. Almost all of his pieces are written for the piano. He was in very frail health throughout his life, and thus he gave few public performances although he was a virtuoso at the piano.</p>

					<p>Chopin met moderate success as a piano teacher, with clients from royalty and rich families. In composing, he strived for perfection and would work to improve and fine-tune the same piece for some time. He moved to Paris when he was twenty, and while he never returned to Warsaw, his birthplace, he still wrote pieces for his homeland, for example: the <em>Revolutionary Etude</em>, which is violent and emotional, composed after Warsaw fell to Russia.</p>

					<p>Chopin brought incredible texture to the piano that no other composer had done before. His revolutionary technique is what brought him success when other famous composers of the time wrote large-scale concertos and symphonies for orchestras, rather than short pieces like Chopin. He had a light, delicate and tender composing and playing style, which helped to convey the complex emotion of his music.</p>

					Tchaikovsky
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/tchaikovsky.jpg">
					<p><strong>Pyotr Ilych Tchaikovsky</strong> (1840-1893) was one of the most influential Russian Romantic composers. Although his life was full of pain and sadness, his pieces do not mirror it. He often wrote cheerful and light-hearted music during suffering.</p>

					<p>Tchaikovsky began his musical career as a professor in music. The heartbreak that characterised his life began early on, when his mother died at the age of fourteen. Later on, he suffered from depression and struggled with homosexuality. When he entered into a close friendship with Madame Nadejda von Meck, she gave him an allowance so that he could focus on composing rather than work. However, this apparent high point in his life ended with her practically abandoning him out of the blue.</p>

					<p>Tchaikovsky is known for his beautiful melodies and orchestration. He did not directly express his pain in his music often, with the notable exception of the 6th Symphony, his last work. He put his whole soul into his work, evident in the mournful and passionate final movement. He died a week after it was performed.</p>

			<div class="period-title">Modern</div>
			<div class="period-text">
				The Modern period sees a departure from traditional form. Music written as praise to God, or as beautiful pieces of art grew less and less common. In their place were philosophical commentaries, supporting ideologies such as humanism and existentialism.

					Debussy
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/debussy.jpg">
					<p><strong>Claude Achille Debussy</strong> (1862-1918) was one of the most influential composers for the piano in history. His music and personality are fascinating. He was atheistic, arrogant, and hedonistic, caring only about himself. This is shown not only in his indulgence in food, which led to his financial poverty, but his refusal to abide by traditional musical rules.</p>

					<p>Debussy grew up near Paris, France. He had no formal education except for piano lessons. His talent for it allowed him to join the Paris Conservatory when he was only eleven. Afterwards, he gained much experience and exposure from going to Russia with Madame Nadejda von Meck, and going to Rome. When he returned to Paris, he picked up several wives and spent time with Impressionist and Symbolist artists. They, along with far Eastern music, had a large influence on his music.</p>

					<p>Debussy's favourite instrument was the piano, much like Beethoven and Chopin. However, he hated Beethoven's piano writing as well as his repetitive sonata and symphony form. His piano pieces perfectly portray the vagueness and light of Impressionist painting.

					Rachmaninoff
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/rachmaninoff.jpg">
					<p><strong>Sergei Rachmaninoff</strong> (1873-1943) was known for his virtuoso piano skill, and for his piano concertos. His 3rd Piano Concerto is widely considered one of the hardest of all time.</p>

					<p>Rachmaninoff was born in Novgorod, Russia, but his family moved to Petersburg in 1882. His father left at a young age, and his absence played a part in his lack of discipline in school. His cousin noticed his untapped potential and found him a music teacher, Professor Nikolai Zverev. It was through extensive study and practice with him that Rachmaninoff became a piano prodigy. His memory was excellent, and he had big hands, further helping him to play difficult pieces easily. Despite his talent at the piano, his First Symphony's first performance was performed and played badly. Following this, he suffered from depression for the rest of his life.</p>

					<p>Rachmaninoff took great inspiration from Tchaikovsky, as one of the last Romantic composers or a Modern composer who held on to the Tchaikovsky's Romantic style. His music was Russian, melodic and expressive. He enjoyed solitude for composing, and apart from writing his music he was also a skilled pianist and conductor.</p>

					Stravinsky
				</div>
				<div class="composer-text">
					<img src="/res/stravinsky.jpg">
					<p><strong>Igor Stravinsky</strong> (1882-1971) was a Russian composer. His music was a breakthrough in rhythm, shocking the audience and laying the foundations for later jazz. He went through several phases with different musical styles in his life: including his time as a student under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, his traditional Classical compositions, and his usage of serial twelve-tone writing similar to Schoenberg.</p>

					<p>Stravinsky was born near St. Petersburg. His father was an operatic bass, and music was a part of his life from early on. He studied law in university, getting to know the son of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Soon after, he began studying composition under him, which lasted for three years. Afterwards, he met the owner of the Russian Ballet Company, Sergei Diaghilev, whom he wrote music for until Diaghilev's death.</p>

					<p>After the Russian Revolution in 1917, he worked on the theatrical <em>L'Histoire du Soldat</em> together with two of his friends, performed on the piano and conducted to earn a living. After World War I, he moved to France, and then to America at the beginning of World War II. He wrote music throughout this time.</p>

					<p>Stravinsky was a Christian, and wrote music to glorify God. However, he also believed that music should not have an intrinsic meaning or value.</p>
